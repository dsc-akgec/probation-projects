The aim of this project is to predict the wildfire before it happens.Through the climatic data collected by the sensors,such as temperature
,relative humidity,month,soil moisture, .These features predict the forestfire and it predict the probability of the wildfire.As wildfire 
is also caused by human consequences ,so i have also applied image recognition (deep learning) techniques to identify if fire has taken 
place.
